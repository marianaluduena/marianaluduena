## Bio

üëã Hi, nice to meet you! I define myself as a **self-taught** person with a strong **curiosity** about how things work. I started learning how to program, and front end basic technologies by doing my own web sites.

Seeking to explore other areas of the IT sector, I became interested in **software testing** and ensuring its highest possible quality. This led me to take a course in QA Manual Testing, where I delved into the **software life cycle**, **designed** and **executed test cases**, **reported discovered bugs**, learned about **different types of issues**, and **REST** and **SOAP** **APIs**.

At present, I am enhancing my understanding of **testing methods** and **tools** through online courses, and by evaluating web applications designed for educational purposes. During the testing process I use **Jira** to get familiar with it, how it works, how **agile methodologies** work, and as a simulation of a real daily work environment.

 I would be thrilled to apply what I've learned to assess a live product and acquire practical experience. 
 
 Over the next two years, my **goal** is to advance to a **mid-level software tester**!

 ## Skills:

### Manual Testing:

- Exploratory testing

-  Functional and usability testing of web applications
  

### Automation Testing:

- **OOP Javascript**
  
- **API Automation with Postman** 
  
- **Cypress (in progress)**
  
- **Web Testing with Playwright (in porgress)**
  
- Automated tests and **DOM manipulation with Javascript and DevTools**
  

### Test Documentation:

- Create manual test cases, preconditions, test plans, and test execution with **Agile Test** and **X Ray**.

- Familiar writing comprehensive bug reports with the steps to replicate the issue.

- Documentation of **evidence** with **ScreenToGif**.


### Agile Methodologies:

- Familiar with **Srum** and **Kanban**.


### API Testing:

- Familiar with **Postman**
- Know how to manipulate requests
- Knowleadge with GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE
- Familiar with **API Documentation**
- **Gained experience through manual & automation testing.**

### Programming Languages:

- Javascript
- PHP
- MySQL


### Web Development

- Bootstrap
- SASS
- Responsive Design
- Mobile first
- React.js

  ### Others:

  - Git and GitHub.
  

 ## üõ†Ô∏è Tools:

  - **Jira**: I've learned how to **create projects**, **track** and **report** issues and **tasks management** by simulating a **sprint**, and also to get a feel for how **agile methodologies** work.
    
  - **Agile Test and X Ray**: I've learned how to **create manual test cases**, **add preconditions**, **write test plans** and **bug reports**.
    
  - **ScreenToGif**: my favorite tool to **document evidence**! (More **visual**, more **useful** than just an image to ilustrate issues, **easy** to use, **free**, and **lighter than videos**!)
    
  - **Postman**: I've gained experience through manual testing of public APIs used for educational purposes.
    
  - **Browser Developer's Tools**: **Network** and **Lighthouse**.

  - **JMeter** 


## Examples of my work:

## QA Testing

### Test Cases

#### Wander Project - Igrowker Junior IT Training Internship (2024)
