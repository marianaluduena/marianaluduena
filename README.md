- 👋 Hi, I’m Mariana Ludueña and I'm from Argentina. I define myself as a self-taught individual with a strong curiosity about how things work. I started learning web development on my own until, in 2021, I decided to deepen my knowledge at Coder House with a web development course.
Seeking to explore other areas of the IT sector, I became interested in software testing and ensuring its highest possible quality. This led me to take a course in QA Manual Testing, where I delved into the software life cycle, designed and executed test cases, reported discovered bugs, and learned about different types of issues.
- 👀 I’m interested in:

 - QA Testing (Manual and Automation)
 - API Testing
 - Javascript
 -  Python 🐍
 -  SQL
 -  Cybersecurity ^^
 -  English and German
-   Magic ✨✨

- 🌱 I’m always practicing my front-end skills by doing small personal proyects.
 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects with JS.
