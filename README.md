BIO

👋 Hi, I’m Mariana Ludueña and I'm from Argentina. I define myself as a self-taught individual with a strong curiosity about how things work. I started learning web development on my own until, in 2021, I decided to deepen my knowledge at Coder House with a web development course.
Seeking to explore other areas of the IT sector, I became interested in software testing and ensuring its highest possible quality. This led me to take a course in QA Manual Testing, where I delved into the software life cycle, designed and executed test cases, reported discovered bugs, and learned about different types of issues.

Now:

- Postman API Fundamentals Student Expert certification (currently)
- I've just finished a QA Manual course in Coderhouse
- I'm learning Javascript and I want to have a deep undestanding of it
- 🌱 I’m always practicing my front-end skills by doing small personal proyects

 👀 I’m interested in:

 - QA Testing (Manual and Automation)
 - API Testing
 - Programming languages: Javascript, Python 🐍
 -  SQL and Data Bases
 -  Security of web aplications

Fun fucts: 

- I do magic tricks just for fun and to learn how to think out of the box ✨✨
- I love to write stories (reading good ones too!)
- I've studied German for four years in a languages school, but first I started learning German by myself
- Reading, warching movies, series and tutorials and listening to music in English are not just only my hobbies, but they help me a lot to improve my English too.
