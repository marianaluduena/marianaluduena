## Bio

Hi, nice to meet you! I'm a **QA Tester** from **Argentina** with **1 and a half year of experience** in **functional**, **exploratory**, **API** and **regression testing.** 

I started in 2019 learning how to program by doing my own web sites, and then I became interested in **software testing** and ensuring its highest possible quality. At present, I'm learning **Automation** with **Playwright** through online courses, and putting my skills to the test by doing my own **personal projects and professional IT trainings.** 

Over the next two years, my **goal** is to advance to a **mid-level software tester**!
