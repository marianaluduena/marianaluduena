## Bio

👋 Hi, nice to meet you! I'm from Argentina, and I define myself as a **self-taught** person with a strong **curiosity** about how things work. I started learning how to program, and front end basic technologies by doing my own web sites. Seeking to explore other areas of the IT sector, I became interested in **software testing** and ensuring its highest possible quality. 

At present, I'm learning Automation with **Playwright** and **Cypress** through online courses, and putting my skills to the test by doing my own personal projects. 

Over the next two years, my **goal** is to advance to a **mid-level software tester**!
