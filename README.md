# Bio

👋 Hi, I’m Mariana Ludueña and I'm from Argentina. I define myself as a **self-taught** individual with a strong **curiosity** about how things work. I started learning how to program, and front end basic technologies (HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, Javascript) by doing my own web sites.

Seeking to explore other areas of the IT sector, I became interested in **software testing** and ensuring its highest possible quality. This led me to take a course in QA Manual Testing, where I delved into the **software life cycle**, **designed** and **executed test cases**, **reported discovered bugs**, learned about **different types of issues**, and **REST** and **SOAP** **APIs**.

At present, I am enhancing my understanding of **testing methods** and **tools** through online courses, and by evaluating web applications designed for educational purposes. During the testing process I use **Jira** to get familiar with it, how it works, how **agile methodologies** work, and as a simulation of a real daily work environment.

 I would be thrilled to apply what I've learned to assess a live product and acquire practical experience. 
 
 Over the next two years, my **goal** is to advance to a **mid-level software tester**!

 ## Skills:

### Manual Testing:

- Exploratory testing

-  Functional and usability testing of web applications

### Test Documentation:

- Create manual test cases, preconditions, test plans, and test execution with **Agile Test**

- Familiar writing comprehensive bug reports with the steps to replicate the issue.

- Documentation of **evidence** with **ScreeenToGif**


### Agile Methodollogies:

- Familiar with **Jira**


### API Testing:

- Familiar with **Postman**
- Know how to manipulate requests
- Knowleadge with GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE
- Familiar with **API Documentation**
- Gained experience through manual testing of free APIs (PokéAPI, SWAPI)

  

 ## 🛠️ Tools:

  - **Jira**: I've learned how to **create projects**, **track** and **report** issues and **tasks management** by simulating a **sprint**, and also to get a feel for how **agile methodologies** work.
    
  - **Agile Test**: I've learned how to **create manual test cases**, **add preconditions**, **write test plans** and **bug reports**.
    
  - **ScreenToGif**: my favorite tool to **document evidence**! (More **visual**, more **useful** than just an image to ilustrate issues, **easy** to use, **free**, and **lighter than videos**!)
    
  - **Postman**: I've gained experience through manual testing of public APIs used for educational purposes.
    
  - **Browser Developer's Tools**: **Network** and **Lighthouse**.
